## Project made for Sofixit 'Code Wars' competition

The project is written for demonstrating purposes of
my algorithm

It's written using technologies listed below:
1. TypeScript since it's better than JS
2. React for building reactive UI
3. Styled Components for embedding CSS into TS files
4. Recoil for state management

In order to run project locally, you need to 
do the following steps:
1. Clone the repo from my GitHub
2. __npm install__ all the packages
3. __npm start__ to run application locally (probably on port :3000)
4. optionally, you can test the function containing algorithm using __npm test__

So all the commands look that way:
```shell
# shell script (works on Linux and MacOS)
git clone https://github.com/it1shka/material-visualization
cd material-visualization
npm install
npm start
# optionally, if you wanna test it:
npm test
```
